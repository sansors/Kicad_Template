It's a template for De10-Nano Board of Terasic.

The names of the header do not respect the official schematic, because this one does not mention the LTC header.
So I put arbitrary references.

Please look closely at the correspondence between the sample pcb and the basic schematic.

For the moment NOT TESTED, to use at your own risk!
